     is a cartoon beagle from the Peanuts comic strip. He is white and black and he's so cool!!!
     Snoopy is owned by Charlie Brown.

    <p>Three reasons I admire Snoopy:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>He is a man's best friend</li>
        <li>He's really cute</li>
        <li>He also goes by Joe Cool and that's really cool</li>
    </ul>
